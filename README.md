Phase one design features basic functionality and style for multiple features.

In phase two, we have introduced an updated UI, style, and responsive design. City search feature has been enhanced as well as a function that displays relevant alternative images if there are none for a given city. We have also developed functionality for saving, editing, and deleting the user's vacation plans. Vacation plans are saved to local storage and organized by date.
