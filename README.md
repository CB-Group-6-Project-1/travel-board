<img src="assets\images\readme-imgs\vacation-calendar-page.png">
</details>

In phase two, we have introduced an updated UI, style, and responsive design. City search feature has been enhanced as well as a function that displays relevant alternative images if there are none for a given city. We have also developed functionality for saving, editing, and deleting the user's vacation plans. Vacation plans are saved to local storage and organized by date.
